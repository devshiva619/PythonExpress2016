# Python Tutorial

This is just another tutorial to get started with Python 2, 
As I go along with my learning, I will try to scrible it all along

I will be using this for all the Python 101 workshop at various colleges.

Special thanks to my teacher Mr. Chandrashekhar Babu, all the tutorial are based on the training he provided in one of his training workshop. 


Python is an easy to learn language with respect to other programming languages to get start with.
It is not limited to automation, or web development, or network programming, as you can build games and applications for almost anything.
